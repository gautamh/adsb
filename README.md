# Which side of the plane should you sit on?
See the ![project site](https://gautamh.github.io/window-seat) for some examples results from this project.

Window seats are indisputably the best seats on the plane. An airplane window gives a unique perspective on the world, and one of the best elements of that perspective is the view you get when approaching an airport. Flying into New York, you can see the Manhattan skyline. Landing in Seattle, you can see the Space Needle. The distinctive [River Visual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport#Approach_patterns) approach into National Airport in DC provides a view of the Washington Monument, the White House, and other DC landmarks.

But the view you get on approach into an airport is determined by which side of the plane you sit on. If you're flying into an airport you're not familiar with, it can be difficult to know whether to pick a window on the left or right side of the plane. This project is an attempt to help answer that question. 

The premise is that population density is a good proxy for the quality of the view which an area provides, so if you can figure out what sort of population density you are seeing out of each side of the plane on approach, you can determine which view is best:
